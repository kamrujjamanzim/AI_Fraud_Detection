# 🛠 AI Fraud Detection & Transaction Monitoring  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Banks & e-commerce firms lose billions annually due to fraudulent payments.  
This project builds an AI-powered fraud detection system that:  
- Detects suspicious transactions in real time.  
- Minimizes false positives.  
- Provides SHAP-based explanations for compliance officers.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **report/** → Word/PDF project report.  
- **notebooks/** → Exploratory analysis + model building (HTML & Jupyter).  
- **src/** → Python scripts & FastAPI scoring service.  
- **data/** → Sample transactions (demo only).  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, FastAPI)  
- SQL (PostgreSQL for ingestion & cleaning)  
- Power BI (dashboard design – planned)  

## 📊 Key Results  
- XGBoost ROC-AUC: **0.98**  
- Recall (fraud detection rate): **95%**  
- False Positives reduced to <10% with SHAP interpretability.  

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Deploy API on AWS Lambda/EC2.  
- Live monitoring dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).  
- Graph Neural Networks for fraud ring detection.
